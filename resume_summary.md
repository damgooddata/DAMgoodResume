### DAMgoodData Mission & Philosophy

**Mission Statement:**
Founded DAMgoodData to empower growing businesses and mission-driven organizations by building processes and systems that stand the test of time. Let clients do what they do best—manage and grow their business—while David automates the mundane day-to-day reporting and admin tasks that keep the lights on.

**The Problem David Solves:**
After years in corporate environments going "around your elbow" to get data or information for reports, David recognized a universal challenge: businesses and organizations waste enormous time on reporting and administrative overhead when they should be focused on their core mission. People who are doing things the right way and actively growing shouldn't have to also become experts in data and reporting infrastructure.

**The DAMgoodData Approach:**
- **Empower, don't burden:** Free up clients' time to keep doing what got them to this point—growing and succeeding
- **Remove friction, don't just digitize it:** Salesforce approval process didn't just replace Excel tracking; it REMOVED steps, making it quicker and easier than the manual process
- **Build for longevity:** Systems and processes designed to stand the test of time, not quick fixes that create future problems
- **Client focus stays on core business:** Clients manage their business; David manages the data automation
- Helping businesses optimize operations so good they'll say "DAM that's good data!"

**Core Philosophy: "If You're Going to Do a Job, Do It Right"**

Rather than quick fixes or short-term patches, David advocates for building proper solutions with long-term sustainability in mind. This means:

- **Strategic Over Expedient:** Push back against "just get it done" mentality when it means sacrificing long-term value
- **Right Technology for the Job:** Advocate for appropriate solutions even when clients resist complexity (AI/ML, API integrations vs. manual processes)
- **Long-term Cost Consideration:** Every solution designed with future maintenance, scalability, and total cost of ownership in mind
- **Technology Advocacy:** Help clients understand when investing in the right technology (APIs, automation, AI) delivers exponentially better outcomes than manual workarounds

**Approach & Management Style:**

- **Whale Done Philosophy:** Focus on solutions over emotions or politics. Positive reinforcement and forward momentum over blame or conflict.
- **Jack Welch Style:** "Measure everything, sell hard!" Data-driven decision making and clear metrics for success.
- **Results-Based Pricing:** Fair pricing model (~10% of cost savings) that aligns success with client outcomes - not about getting rich, but about demonstrating clear ROI.

**Value Proposition:**
When organizations are willing to invest in doing things right the first time, the long-term savings, efficiency gains, and operational improvements far exceed the initial investment. DAMgoodData exists to bring enterprise-grade data solutions to mission-driven organizations that might not otherwise have access to this level of expertise.

## Work Preferences & Availability

**Work Style:** Remote or Hybrid (with flexibility for climbing travel)
**Location:** Open to remote opportunities anywhere; hybrid roles must accommodate climbing travel schedule across the United States
**Work Environment Preference:** Seeking smaller, growing companies where systems and process optimization drives growth—not interested in standard corporate roles unless fully remote
**Not Interested In:** Office-based remedial work that could be done remotely; corporate bureaucracy without meaningful impact

---

## Core Competencies & What I Do Best

### Primary Strengths
- **Automate repetitive work end-to-end**: Remove manual steps, reduce errors, and speed up cycle times
- **Transform disordered environments into structured systems**: Excel at bringing order to chaos in high-pressure situations
- **Build scalable data pipelines & reporting**: Reliable data transformations, real-time/near-real-time visibility for decision-making
- **Integrate systems via APIs**: Connect SaaS + internal tooling (Microsoft/Google ecosystems, Salesforce, etc.)
- **Deliver usable tools for non-technical teams**: Clear UX, validation/error handling, documentation, and training
- **Field-ready solutions for low-tech environments**: Build robust systems that work with limited technical infrastructure
- **Cross-cultural user training**: Positive reinforcement coaching approach

### Leadership & Work Style Philosophy

**Positive Reinforcement Approach (Whale Done):**
- Focus on solutions and forward progress rather than dwelling on problems or assigning blame
- Keep emotions and politics out of technical decisions
- Celebrate wins and use setbacks as learning opportunities
- Build confidence in teams through encouragement and support

**Data-Driven Management (Jack Welch Style):**
- Measure everything: establish clear KPIs and success metrics
- Make decisions based on data, not assumptions
- Transparent reporting and accountability
- "Sell hard" on the value of proper solutions backed by measurable outcomes

**Strategic Advisory Role:**
- Not afraid to push back when clients want quick fixes over proper solutions
- Educate clients on long-term implications of technical decisions
- Advocate for appropriate technology even when it seems complex (AI/ML, APIs, automation)
- Help organizations understand ROI of doing things right vs. ongoing cost of workarounds

All special projects (warehouse moves, physical inventory, Houston expansion) were result of working in a growing startup-like company. **Did whatever it took to get the job done.** This approach is evident in the **public success of Floor & Decor** during these years as the company grew from small startup to publicly-traded retail powerhouse opening 2-3 stores per week.

#### Houston Warehouse Expansion Project (First 3-4 Months)

**The Challenge:**
Expand leased warehouse section without stopping operations. Essentially rebuild a warehouse while it's still operating.

**The Execution:**
- Tore down walls to add new leased section
- Re-engineered entire layout to incorporate new space
- Built new racking, painted new lines
- **David's team responsibilities:**
  - Installed pick location placards (hung above bulk locations)
  - Labeled each tier of racking
  - **Nightly warehouse shifts:** Moved product to allow contractors/painters to work on new areas
  - Documented all product location changes in Manhattan WMS
  - Next day: operations continued picking/shipping
  - Repeated cycle until all construction completed

**WMS System:**
- Manhattan Associates WMS
- Real-time location tracking during expansion
- Ensured zero operational disruption during rebuild

#### Physical Inventory Revolution - WEEK → 2 DAYS

**The Original Process (Week-long nightmare):**
- 4 Distribution Centers, averaging 1M+ sq ft each (largest: 1.4M sq ft)
- Hundreds of printed sheets with location and qty info
- Pallet qty (floor-stacked bulk): count pallets per bay
- Unit qty (racking/shelves): count boxes/pieces (required cherry picker/order picker MHE)
- MWS-enabled scanners: scan location, enter qty, multiple prompts
- Multiple days of counting and recounting until variance acceptable
- Work through night hours trying to close variance gaps
- **Warehouse offline for nearly a week**

**The Transformation:**
After first Miami warehouse physical inventory, David promised himself "never again."

**Real-Time Reconciliation System:**
- **Database Integration:**
  - Captured WMS physical inventory data in real-time
  - 15-minute refresh cycles
  - Snapshot of pre-count inventory (after inventory lock, all tasks completed/cleared)
- **Intelligent Analysis:**
  - Reconciled expected vs. counted in real-time
  - Formula identified user entry errors (e.g., counted eaches instead of boxes)
  - Knew when variance was true vs. data entry mistake
  - Math-based error detection: case qty and box qty division alignment
- **Immediate Correction:**
  - Radioed employees for recounts while still nearby
  - Directed to specific bins with issues
  - Explained what was entered vs. what system expected
- **Result:** Physical inventory completed in **2 business days maximum**
  - Day 1: First count
  - Day 2: Final reconciliations, back to pulling orders by lunch

**Impact:**
- For a company the size of Floor & Decor, warehouse being offline is massive cost
- Real-time reporting prevented extended downtime
- IT eventually built David's reporting directly into Manhattan WMS as a module

**Technologies Used:**
- Manhattan WMS data integration
- SQL Server database
- Real-time data refresh (15-min cycles)
- Custom reconciliation algorithms
- MWS scanner integration

#### LA Warehouse Relocation Application - ALMOST ZERO LOSS

**The Challenge:**
Move entire warehouse without changing warehouse number in Manhattan WMS. Needed warehouse offline for minimal time.

**The Solution - Custom Multi-User Scanning Application:**

**10 Mobile Scanning Stations:**
- Each user managed 4-5 bay doors
- Forklift drivers moved product from location → staging in front of doors
- **Scanner Workflow:**
  - Scan pallet barcodes
  - System had manifest of all inventory
  - Added barcodes to queue, totaled weight
  - **24,000 lb alert** → flag bay as ready to load
  - Move to next bay, repeat
  - Load team begins loading
  - Return to finalize: release trailer for yard jockey
  - Scan two seals, leave on trailer back
  - Driver closes and seals load
  - Jockey parks in loaded section

**Driver Check-In/Out System:**
- Captured driver information
- **Photo of driver ID** for verification
- Issued **driver ID barcode card**
- Directed to pick any trailer from loaded section
- **Check-Out Process:**
  - Scan seal barcode
  - Scan driver card
  - **System prints BOL and packing list**
  - Driver sent to destination

**Destination Receiving:**
- Scan seal + driver card to check in
- Drop loaded trailer, pick up empty
- Unload and scan into Manhattan WMS
- David's program confirms product put-away
- Tracks entire chain of custody

**Outcomes:**
- Hugely successful move
- **Almost nothing lost** in the entire relocation process
- Seamless warehouse transition without Manhattan WMS warehouse number change

**Technologies Used:**
- Custom Python/VBA application
- Mobile barcode scanning integration
- Weight tracking and alert system
- Seal tracking and verification
- Driver ID management with photo capture
- BOL/packing list generation
- Real-time manifest and inventory tracking
- Manhattan WMS integration at destination

#### Domestic Logistics Invoice Automation

**The Problem:**
Managing invoices for third-party delivery vendors for store purchases resulting in home delivery. Would have required hiring a full-time person.

**The Solution - Email-Based Invoice Automation:**

**Strict Format Enforcement:**
- Vendors submit invoices to generic Outlook inbox
- **Very specific format required**
- Program rejects invoice if even one line incorrectly formatted
- Automatic rejection email sent explaining why
- Vendor resubmits corrected invoice

**Processing & Matching:**
- Invoice consumed and processed
- Compared to internal customer orders
- Match found → charge coded for payment
- **Algorithm determines correct GL code** (varied by customer order type)

**Manager Review & Approval:**
- Logistics manager receives report of all charges and GL coding
- Can make changes to GL code or reject payment
- **If no action by end of fiscal week:** charges automatically sent to AP

**AP Payment:**
- AP receives consolidated file
- Simple copy/paste into their system
- Vendor gets paid quickly

**Outcomes:**
- **Saved hiring a full-time employee**
- Automated end-to-end invoice processing
- Fast vendor payment turnaround
- Accurate GL coding via algorithm

**Technologies Used:**
- Outlook email integration
- Python/VBA automation
- Order matching algorithms
- GL code determination logic
- Automated reporting for manager review
- AP system integration

#### Reporting Infrastructure Transformation

**Starting Point (The Horror Show):**
- **"Reporting server":** Old desktop under desk connected to backup battery
- **Databases:** Plethora of Access databases daisy-chained with ODBC connections
- VBA-based rudimentary Excel reports
- Some emailed, some dropped in network directories
- No centralized data management

**The Fight for Data Access:**
- Worked with IT to migrate ODBC connections to SQL Server
- Began transitioning reports from Access → SQL
- **Manhattan WMS data access struggle:**
  - IT wanted David limited to Cognos reports only
  - Cognos good for displaying known-valuable data
  - David needed raw data to **discover** value for Cognos
  - Eventually won access to build analytics from scratch

**User Input Data Challenge:**
- Most reporting required manual user input data
- Data from systems without ODBC access
- Worked with IT to migrate these tables to accessible database

**Outcome:**
- Transformed from Access chaos to SQL Server-based reporting
- Centralized data warehouse
- Foundation for analytics and business intelligence

---

#### International Logistics & FTZ Compliance

### Southeastern Grocers - Supply Chain Auditor
**Duration:** July 2013 - June 2016
**Location:** Jacksonville, FL
**Stores Managed:** All Southeastern Grocers locations (Winn Dixie and Bi-Lo)

#### Delivery Schedule Optimization & Network Management

**Context:**
Southeastern Grocers sold their warehouse operations to 3rd party C&S Wholesale. All deliveries managed by 3rd party with contractual penalties for both under-delivery (lost sales) and over-delivery (excess inventory penalties).

**Commodity-Based Delivery Frequency System:**
- Delivery frequency determined by total tonnage thresholds
- **Different thresholds per commodity:**
  - Dry goods: 10,000 lbs threshold = 1 delivery
  - Frozen: 2,000 lbs threshold = 1 delivery
- **Example calculation:**
  - Store with 10,000 lbs weekly frozen demand = 5 frozen deliveries
  - Same store with 10,000 lbs dry goods demand = 1 dry delivery

**Seasonal Demand Management:**
- Built dashboard monitoring average demand shifts across all stores
- **Critical for seasonal impact identification:**
  - Tourist-driven demand spikes
  - Example: One store doing **$1M in sales on 4th of July weekend** but not $1M for rest of entire year
  - Had to identify seasonal shifts **before they occurred** or stores had empty shelves

**Responsibilities:**
- **Defined number of deliveries per store** based on demand analysis
- **Justified exceptions** and their contractual expenses to C&S Wholesale
- **Worked with warehouse logistics teams** to define actual delivery schedules by store (M-W-F patterns)
- **Constraint management:** Limited trucks and drivers - couldn't hire haphazardly to fulfill demand
- **Managed delivery schedules for ALL Southeastern Grocers stores** (Winn Dixie and Bi-Lo)

**Technologies Used:**
- Dashboard development for real-time demand monitoring
- Network analysis for delivery optimization
- Seasonal trend analysis and forecasting

**Outcomes:**

## Work Style & Client Approach

### Core Philosophy: "Do It Right or Don't Do It At All"
David doesn't believe in quick fixes that create long-term technical debt. When clients push for expedient solutions over proper ones, he advocates for the right approach—even when it means having difficult conversations about complexity, cost, or timelines.

### Communication & Collaboration
- **Practical, direct, outcomes-focused:** Clarity over fluff, solutions over politics
- **Technology advocacy:** Not afraid to push back when clients want to avoid necessary complexity (AI/ML, APIs, automation)
- **Educational approach:** Help stakeholders understand ROI of doing things right vs. ongoing cost of manual workarounds
- **Whale Done philosophy:** Focus on solutions and forward momentum rather than blame or conflict
- Articulating complex data concepts to diverse stakeholders
- Forging strong relationships across technical and business teams

### Problem-Solving Approach
- **Strategic over expedient:** Push back against "just get it done" mentality when it sacrifices long-term value
- **Long-term cost consideration:** Every solution designed with future maintenance, scalability, and total cost of ownership in mind
- **Data-driven decisions (Jack Welch style):** "Measure everything, sell hard!" - establish clear KPIs and success metrics
- Collaborative discovery: observe workflows, document requirements, then automate safely
- Dissecting complex business requirements to unearth deficiencies and opportunities
- Analytical prowess driving competitive advantage and revenue growth

### Implementation Philosophy
- Emphasis on **scalability**, **sustainability**, and **flexibility**
- **Right technology for the job:** Advocate for appropriate solutions even when they seem complex
- Enablement mindset: documentation + training so teams can own and evolve solutions
- Automation-first solutions focused on efficiency and precision
- Positive reinforcement coaching (Whale Done) for user adoption

### Pricing & Value Alignment
- **Results-based pricing model:** ~10% of cost savings aligns success with client outcomes
- Not about getting rich—about demonstrating clear, measurable ROI
- Fair compensation for bringing enterprise-grade solutions to mission-driven organizations

---

---

## Target Roles & Career Opportunities

### Primary Target: Smaller Growth Companies

**Ideal Role Profile:**
David is seeking opportunities with smaller, growing companies where building systems and optimizing processes directly drives company growth. Not interested in roles where companies are just "trying to make it to the end of the week" and view automation as a pipe dream rather than investing in doing things right.

### Technical Roles of Interest

**1. Advanced Salesforce Engineer (NOT Admin)**
- **Focus:** Custom Apex development, complex business logic, system architecture
- **NOT interested in:** Admin work (updating lists, user management)
- **Example:** Enjoyed optimizing Salesforce org for Center for Educational Reform
- Open to contract-based work

**2. Data Engineer / Automation Specialist**

- Building scalable foundations for growth

### Alternative Career Considerations

David is also open to career shifts leveraging climbing expertise:
- **Rope Access Technician** - Using climbing skills professionally
- **Rigging Specialist** - Technical rope work and safety systems
- **Tree Surgeon** - If compensation is right with benefits including free gear and climbing time off

### Work Environment Requirements

**Must Have:**
- **Remote or flexible hybrid** that accommodates climbing travel across the US
- Companies that value "doing it right" over quick fixes
- Meaningful impact on business growth and operations
- Contract-based work acceptable

**Deal Breakers:**
